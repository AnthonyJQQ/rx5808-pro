== Why RSSI calibration ==

*YOU MUST CONFIGURE THE RSSI SIGNAL ONCE*

The automatic search and Scanner (Spectrum analyser) needs a calibration of the RSSI values.

The reason is, that the software *MUST* scale the measured voltages from the receiver to the graphical range.

Beside that the threshold of the seek (channel found) is also scaled.

Inside the software the RSSI is considered in a range from 1...100%.

The problem is, that the phyical voltage from the rx5808 is depending of your unit, the antenna and the TX signal strength.

== RSSI calibration ==

The calibration can be done at ANY time.

For the calibration enter the "SAVE SETUP" menu.

It will save the current settings.

After 2 Seconds a "Hidden" Enter function is available.

*Note: It is hidden to prevent a new calibration in the field*
