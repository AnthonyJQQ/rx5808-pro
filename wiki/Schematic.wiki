#summary Schematic of rx5808-pro

= Schematic =

There are multiple ways to Build your Receiver with that scope of functions that fit´s perfect for your needs.
The software you need is for all the Schematics the same and could be found under "Software"

If you just want a cheap 32Ch Receiver with frequency setup via DIP Switches, follow this schematic (in this version you cant use the Autoscan or the Spektrumanalyzer!):

If you want to build it the easiest way, follow this schematic (Yes with this Version you can Use the FULL SCOPE OF FUNCTIONS Except the Channel switching with the DIP´s):

If you want to modify your cheap Boscam 32Ch Autoscan (which is no real autoscan... search the web!) Receiver and just have 3 Buttons and not so much space,
follow this schematic:

If You want the premium version with 4 Buttons but you doesn´t need the DIP Switches, take that schematic:

But if you want to use all Functions, you have to wire it up like in this schematic:

These are just examples how you can set up your own receiver Hardware! If you dont know which version you should take, here a short descripion which thing is
necessary for what:

|| The Dip Switches || Manually Change the Channel and Band without using the OSD Menue ||	
|| The Save Button  || For fast Saving without the Save Function of the menu (Needed to enter the RSSI Setup, but you just have to do this one time, so you can use a wire to ground that pad one time) ||
|| The Menu Button  || Mandatory if you want to use the full scope of Functions, Needet to enter Menu ^^ and to select the menue functions ||
|| Up Button || You minimum need one of the 2 direction buttons (Up or Down) for Switching the Frequenzies in the manual Mode forward ||
|| Down Button || Same as Up Button just in the other way (switch the frequencys backwards) ||
|| The Buzzer || Necessary for Audio Feedback of button operation, Finishing the Autoscan etc. ||
|| The RSSI Signal || Mandatory for the Autoscan and Spektrumanalyzer function (Gives the Strength of the received Signal to the Ardino) ||
