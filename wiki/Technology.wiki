#summary Overview of used technology

= 5.8 GHz Channels =

In the RC modeler scene a 5.8GHz uncompressed video link is standard.

The 5.8GHz band has up to 32 different channels that can be used.

The channel is selected depending of the used equipment and location (law restictions).

Here is a list of valid channels:

||  Band  || CH 1 || CH 2 || CH 3 || CH 4 || CH 5 || CH 6 || CH 7 || CH 8 ||
|| Band A || 5865 || 5845 || 5825 || 5805 || 5785 || 5765 || 5745 || 5725 ||
|| Band B || 5733 || 5752 || 5771 || 5790 || 5809 || 5828 || 5847 || 5866 ||
|| Band E || 5705 || 5685 || 5665 || 5645 || 5885 || 5905 || 5925 || 5945 ||
|| Band F || 5740 || 5760 || 5780 || 5800 || 5820 || 5840 || 5860 || 5880 ||

== Special Notes ==

All the bands are overlapping. Than means not all 32 channels can be used at once.
In practise 4-6 channles may run together.

Beside that the channel number are sometime not coralating the freqency.
Check the Band E (step from CH4 -> CH 5) and decending oder (Band A).

= rx5805 Module =

The BOSCAM rx5808 modules is popular in the builder scene since it is small and cheap.

The quality is not great, but OK.

It popularity leads to some developments like this project.

The basis of this project is the SPI interface for the modules.

[http://www.datasheet4u.com/datasheet-pdf/RichWave/RTC6715/pdf.php?id=785220 Details of the used RTC6715 can be found here.]

== SPI patch ==

By default the freqency selection happen with 3 controll pins (CH1, CH2, CH3).

By enabling the SPI interface this 3 pins will become the SPI interface pins.

SPI has 3 pins:

   * CLK
   * SELECT
   * DATA

After the patch the mapping is the following:

|| *Default Pin* || *SPI Pin* ||
|| CH 1          ||  DATA     ||
|| CH 2          ||  SELECT   ||
|| CH 3          ||  CLOCK    ||

The SPI mode is controll by the SPI_EN pin on the chip.

This pin must be set to *HIGH* to get SPI on.

Currently there are two version of the module (see printer backside):

   * RX5808 (old version)
   * RX5808 20120322 (Version 22th March 2012)

== RX5808 (old version) Patch ==

Here the SPI_EN pin tight directly to GND. 
When the GND connection is loosen, an internal pullup resitor sets the required *HIGH*.

The follwing picture shows the module (with removed shield cover) from top an back.

For the patch a via must be drilled (*CAREFULLY*) to diconnect the GND from SPI_EN pin.

*NICE: Shield cover must not be removed*

*BAD: This modules are no longer on sale*

== RX5808 20120322 Patch ==

The new module has an pull down SMD resitor connected to the pin.

*FOR THIS OPERATION THE SHIELD COVER MUST BE REMOVED.*

The following pictures are showing the open module with the restor to be removed.
